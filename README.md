# ClassificationNODEs

Simulation of the algorithm for binary classification with neural ODEs defined in 

"D. Ruiz-Balet, E. Zuazua, Neural ODE control for classification, approximation and transport, SIAM Review, 65 (3), 735â€“773, 2023".

This algorithm is constructive and follows a point-by-point strategy

Gifs are genereated for different values of the dimension and of the number of points
