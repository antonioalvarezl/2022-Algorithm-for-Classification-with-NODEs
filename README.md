# ClassificationNODEs

Simulation of the algorithm for binary classification with neural ODEs defined in:

"D. Ruiz-Balet, E. Zuazua, Neural ODE control for classification, approximation and transport, SIAM Review, 65 (3), 735â€“773, 2023".

This algorithm is constructive and follows a point-by-point strategy.

Gifs are generated for different values of the dimension of the space (d) and the number of points of each color (N).

The representations for d>1 are the projections on the two first coordinates
